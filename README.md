## Global Carbon Pricing & Emissions Tracker

This Excel dashboard explores how carbon pricing, using taxes and cap-and-trade systems, is being used around the world to combat climate change. I analyzed data from the World Bank, EU ETS, and global emissions databases to compare carbon prices across different countries, track how adoption has grown since 2010, and examine whether these policies are actually reducing emissions. The dashboard uses Power Query to clean and combine multiple data sources, pivot tables for analysis, and interactive slicers so users can filter by region, policy type, and time period to explore the data themselves.
