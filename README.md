## European Energy Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard provides an overview of Europe’s electricity generation and cross-border power flows. Using ENTSO-E data, it visualizes total generation by energy source (including nuclear, fossil gas, coal, hydro, wind, solar, and biomass), highlights nuclear power generation since 2023, and maps electricity trade flows between countries from 2019 onward. Interactive visuals allow users to compare energy mixes, analyze generation volumes in GWh, and explore how interconnected European electricity markets distribute power across borders.

## Swiss Economic Policy Analysis

This Python project analyzes Swiss economic indicators using SNB and Federal Statistical Office data. I built interactive Plotly visualizations examining GDP, inflation, unemployment, and exchange rates (2000-2024), exploring monetary policy impacts. Demonstrates full data pipeline: API collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization in Colab.

## Global Carbon Pricing & Emissions Tracker

This Excel dashboard analyzes carbon pricing mechanisms across 73 jurisdictions worldwide. Using World Bank State and Trends of Carbon Pricing (2024) and Climate Watch emissions data, I examined pricing trends from 2015-2024, compared carbon tax versus emissions trading systems, and explored the relationship between carbon prices and emissions. Built with Excel pivot tables, charts, and formulas.
