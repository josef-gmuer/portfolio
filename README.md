## Global Carbon Pricing & Emissions Tracker

This Excel dashboard analyzes carbon pricing mechanisms across 73 jurisdictions worldwide. Using World Bank State and Trends of Carbon Pricing (2024) and Climate Watch emissions data, I examined pricing trends from 2015-2024, compared carbon tax versus emissions trading systems, and explored the relationship between carbon prices and emissions. Built with Excel pivot tables, charts, and formulas.

## European Energy Transition Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard tracks Europe's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy across major EU countries. Using ENTSO-E electricity data, I analyzed generation mix trends from 2015-2024, mapped renewable energy share by country, and visualized cross-border electricity flows. The dashboard uses interactive slicers and dynamic charts to explore how solar and wind capacity has grown while coal generation has declined across the continent.

## Swiss Economic Policy Analysis

This Python project analyzes Swiss economic indicators using SNB and Federal Statistical Office data. I built interactive Plotly visualizations examining GDP, inflation, unemployment, and exchange rates (2000-2024), exploring monetary policy impacts. Demonstrates full data pipeline: API collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization in Jupyter notebooks.
