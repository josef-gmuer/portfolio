## Global Carbon Pricing & Emissions Tracker

This Excel dashboard explores how carbon pricing is being used globally to combat climate change. I analyzed World Bank and EU ETS data to compare carbon prices across countries, track adoption since 2010, and examine whether these policies are reducing emissions. Built with Power Query, pivot tables, and interactive slicers.

## European Energy Transition Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard tracks Europe's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy across major EU countries. Using ENTSO-E electricity data, I analyzed generation mix trends from 2015-2024, mapped renewable energy share by country, and visualized cross-border electricity flows. The dashboard uses interactive slicers and dynamic charts to explore how solar and wind capacity has grown while coal generation has declined across the continent.

## Swiss Economic Policy Analysis

This Python project analyzes Swiss economic indicators using SNB and Federal Statistical Office data. I built interactive Plotly visualizations examining GDP, inflation, unemployment, and exchange rates (2000-2024), exploring monetary policy impacts. Demonstrates full data pipeline: API collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization in Jupyter notebooks.
